# Advent of Code 2019

Hellooo, these are my solutions for [AoC 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

So far I had to "cheat" twice
- looked up the implementation of a permutations generator
- got stuck on 9a, checked online and found I had to double-check [ALL the write instructions supported `relative mode`](https://github.com/mspreij/adventofcode_2019/commit/6d31cb445bd6eef4c6cd6c97f374d6dab9e0246d).

Only 2 days behind now \o/

update: famous last words >.> 2020 now started
